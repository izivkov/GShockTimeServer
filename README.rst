# GShockTimeServer

## Overview
GShockTimeServer allows you to set the correct time on your Casio G-Shock watches, including:
- [`B5600`](https://amzn.to/3Mt68Qb)
- [`B5000`](https://amzn.to/4194M13)
- [`B2100`](https://amzn.to/3MUDCGY)

Additionally, this repository provides an API for developing applications for these watches. While still a work in progress, you can refer to the `api_tests.py` file for usage examples.

## Usage
This app can run on any device with Python and Bluetooth capabilitiesâ€”from a desktop to a Raspberry Pi Zero.  
It has been tested on Linux but should also work on Windows.

### Setting the Time
1. Ensure the app is running on your device.
2. Short-press the **lower-right** button on your G-Shock watch to connect.
3. Once connected, the app will automatically set the correct time on your watch.
4. If **AUTO TIME ADJUSTMENT** is enabled, the watch will sync up to **four times daily**.

## Virtual Environment Setup
