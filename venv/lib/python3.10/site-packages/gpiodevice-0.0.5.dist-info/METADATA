A GPIO counterpart to [i2cdevice](https://github.com/pimoroni/i2cdevice-python), generated from [the Pimoroni Python Boilerplate](https://github.com/pimoroni/boilerplate-python).

## What is gpiodevice?

gpiodevice is a simple middleware library intended to make some user-facing aspects of interfacing with Linux's GPIO character device ABI (via gpiod) simpler and friendlier.

gpiodevice is not intended to replace gpiod, but collects some common patterns into a reusable library for GPIO-based Python projects.
